This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for predicting cost-effective social services using Python, machine learning models, and the Streamlit framework for creating interactive web applications. The solution will involve data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment of the model using Streamlit.
### About the Project
A linear regression model was created to forecast the cost of both social workers and community connections as part of the investigation. This will help to predict the value of preventive measures and how quantitative monetary estimation can be used to make more informed decisions..
